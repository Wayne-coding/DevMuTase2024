### (1) The model scripts involved in the lifecycle of deep learning models

These scripts are the most critical and flexible part of the model development process, and developers need to constantly adjust and optimize to adapt to changes in data and tasks, as well as improve the performance of the model. These frequent modifications and experiments help gradually find the optimal model architecture and training strategy, thereby improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the model.

***1.Model Definition Script:***

Model architecture is a key factor affecting performance, and developers need to constantly adjust the number of layers, types, and hyperparameters of the model (such as activation functions, convolution kernel sizes, etc.) to optimize performance.

-**Function**: Define the architecture of neural networks, including the types, quantities, and connection methods of each layer.

-***Example***: 'model. py', which includes the definitions of each layer of the model, such as convolutional layers, fully connected layers, etc.

***2.Data processing script:***

Data quality directly affects model performance. Developers need to clean, enhance, and segment data, and adjust processing methods based on the characteristics of the dataset to ensure diversity and quality of data input.

-**Function**: Processing and preprocessing data, including data cleaning, data augmentation, data loading, etc.

-**Example**: 'data_preprocessing. py', which implements image normalization, random cropping, data augmentation, and other operations.

***3.Training Script:***

The training process involves many hyperparameters (such as learning rate, batch size, optimizer type, etc.) and strategies (such as learning rate scheduling, early stopping, etc.). Developers need to continuously adjust these parameters and strategies based on experimental results to improve the convergence speed and final performance of the model.

-**Function**: Define the training process, including loss function, optimizer, number of training rounds, model saving, etc.

-**Example**: 'train. py', which implements training loops, model evaluation, checkpoint saving, etc.

***4.Evaluation Script:***

In order to fully understand the performance of the model, developers need to continuously adjust evaluation methods and indicators (such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, etc.), as well as the selection of validation and testing data, in order to obtain accurate performance feedback.

-**Function**: Evaluate the performance of the model on the validation or testing set, and generate relevant indicators.

-**Example**: 'experiment. py', to organize the experiment and compare the results.

In the actual development process, the training script, inference script, and evaluation script of the model are merged into one execution script, which can simplify the workflow and facilitate management and use. The merged execution script can distinguish training, inference, and evaluation tasks through different parameters or patterns, integrating the training, inference, and evaluation functions of deep learning models. By passing different parameters, users can choose to perform the following actions:

Training model: Train the model on the given dataset and save the trained model weights.

Inference: Use trained models to predict new data and output prediction results.

Evaluation Model: Evaluate the performance of the model on the test set and output evaluation metrics.

### (2) Common modification operations for model scripts

Developers typically perform the following actions on these scripts:

1.**Model Definition Script**:

New architectures often provide better performance, such as higher accuracy or lower computational costs. Adopting the latest network architecture to leverage the latest academic research and technological advancements. Different network structures may perform better on specific tasks, optimizing the performance of specific tasks by replacing model structures.

-**Introducing new network architecture**: Developers may replace the current model structure with new ones such as ResNet, DenseNet, Transformer, etc. This usually involves importing new model definitions and replacing old models with new ones.

-**Replace existing layers**: Sometimes only partial models need to be replaced, such as replacing traditional convolutional layers with more efficient layers (such as depthwise separable convolutions).

By adding layers or parallel structures, the feature extraction and expression capabilities of the model can be improved. Simplify the model structure, reduce the number of parameters, and prevent overfitting. By using parallel paths and skip connections, we can improve gradient flow, prevent gradient vanishing problems, and improve training efficiency.

-**Add New Layer**: Add new layers to the existing model, such as more convolutional layers, fully connected layers, or pooling layers. This is usually used to increase the expressive power of the model.

-**Delete redundant layers**: Simplify the model structure by removing unnecessary layers, reducing computational complexity and overfitting risks.

-**Add Parallel Path**: Introduce parallel paths (such as residual blocks and skip connections) to enhance the model's feature extraction ability and gradient fluidity.

When adding parallel or series structures to deep learning models, attention should be paid to controlling the number of branches, ensuring functional similarity and progression, selecting appropriate fusion mechanisms, considering computational resource consumption, and focusing on gradient flow and regularization measures. Through reasonable design and adjustment, developers can effectively expand the model structure, improve the performance and expressive power of the model.

***a. Precautions when adding parallel structures***

***1.Quantity Limit:***

-**Number of Branches**: In general, it is not recommended to add more than 2 parallel branches. Too many branches can increase the complexity and computational cost of the model, and may also lead to an increase in the complexity of gradient calculation, affecting training efficiency.

***2.Functional Similarity:***

-**Functional consistency**: Newly added parallel structures should have similar or complementary functions. For example, all branches are used for feature extraction or feature extraction at different scales, which ensures that the outputs of different branches are consistent and effective in subsequent fusion.

***3.Integration mechanism:***

***-Suitable fusion method:*** The output of the newly added parallel branch needs to be appropriately fused, such as using concatenation, addition, or average methods. Choosing the appropriate fusion method can ensure the effective combination of features from different branches and improve the model's expressive power.

***4.Computational resources:***

***-Resource consumption:*** Consider adding parallel structures to consume computing resources, ensuring appropriate expansion within the available range of computing resources. Avoid the problem of insufficient memory or long computation time caused by too many branches.

***5.Gradient flow:***

-Gradient problem: The newly added parallel structure should facilitate the smooth flow of gradients and avoid problems such as vanishing or exploding gradients. The problem of gradient vanishing can be alleviated by introducing residual connections and other methods.

b. Notes when adding a series structure

***1.Number of layers and depth:***

***-Layer Control:*** The newly added series structure should not increase the number of layers of the model too much to prevent gradient vanishing or exploding problems caused by the model being too deep. It is generally recommended to gradually increase the number of layers and determine the optimal depth through experiments.

***2.Function progression:***

***-Functional Progression:*** The newly added serial structure should have a progressive relationship in functionality, such as gradually extracting features from lower to higher levels. Ensure that the output of each layer can effectively provide useful feature information for the next layer.

***3.Parameter settings:***

-***Parameter Reasonableness:*** Pay attention to the parameter settings of the new layer, such as convolution kernel size, stride, padding, etc., which should be consistent with the parameter settings of the existing layer to avoid low feature extraction efficiency caused by improper parameters.

***4.Regularization measures:***

-***Regularization:*** The newly added concatenated structure may increase the complexity of the model and easily lead to overfitting. Therefore, regularization measures such as Dropout, Batch Normalization, etc. can be introduced to control the complexity of the model and improve its generalization ability.

5.***Compatibility and Consistency***:

-***Dimension Matching***: Ensure that the input and output dimensions of the new layer match the existing structure, avoiding model runtime errors caused by inconsistent dimensions.

-Consistency verification: Newly added concatenated structures should maintain functional consistency with existing structures to avoid introducing invalid or redundant levels.

In the development of deep learning models, deleting existing parallel or series structures in the model requires attention to the following aspects:

### Precautions when deleting parallel structures

1.***Functional Integrity***

After deleting the parallel structure, ensure that the model's functionality and feature extraction ability are not negatively affected. For example, if parallel structures are used for extracting features of different scales or fusing features of different types, it is necessary to confirm that the model can still effectively extract these features after deletion.

***2.Model Performance***

-Performance evaluation: Before and after deleting the parallel structure, conduct a performance evaluation to ensure that key performance indicators such as accuracy and robustness of the model have not significantly decreased. If the performance decreases, it is necessary to re evaluate and adjust the model structure.

***3.Output Consistency:***

-**Output Dimension Matching**: After deleting the parallel structure, ensure that the output dimensions of the remaining structures are consistent with the expected output dimensions of the model, to avoid model operation errors caused by dimension mismatch.

***4.Gradient flow:***

***-Gradient problem:*** Ensure that the gradient flow is still smooth after removing the parallel structure, avoiding gradient disappearance or explosion problems. The stability of gradients can be ensured by adding residual connections and other methods.

***5.Computational resources:***

***-Resource usage:*** Evaluate the impact of deleting parallel structures on computing resources, such as memory usage and computation time, to ensure optimized and reasonable allocation of resource usage.

In the development of deep learning models, deleting existing parallel or series structures requires attention to functional integrity, model performance, output consistency, gradient flow, computational resource utilization, functional continuity, model depth, parameter adjustment, regularization measures, and compatibility checks. Through comprehensive evaluation and experimental verification, ensure that the model after removing the structure can still run efficiently and stably, and meet application requirements.

***1.Functional Continuity:***

-**Ensure Progressive Relationship**:After deleting the concatenated structure, ensure that the functional progressive relationship between the remaining levels is not compromised. For example, the gradual extraction process from low-level features to high-level features should be continuous.

***2.Model Depth***

-**Reasonable depth control**: After deleting the concatenated structure, ensure that the depth of the model is still within a reasonable range. Deleting too many levels may result in the model being too shallow and insufficient feature extraction ability.

3.**Parameter adjustment**:

-**Parameter Reconfiguration**: After deleting the concatenated structure, it may be necessary to readjust the parameter settings of the remaining layers, such as convolution kernel size, stride, padding, etc., to ensure the effectiveness of feature extraction.

4.**Regularization**:

-**Regularization measures**: Removing concatenated structures may affect the complexity and balance of the model, and it is necessary to re evaluate and adjust regularization measures such as Dropout, Batch Normalization, etc. to control the complexity of the model and improve generalization ability.

5.**Compatibility check**:

-**Dimension Matching**: After deleting the concatenated structure, ensure that the input and output dimensions of the front and back layers match to avoid model running errors caused by inconsistent dimensions.

-**Consistency Verification**: Ensure that the model maintains consistency in functionality after deleting the hierarchy, avoiding the introduction of invalid or redundant adjustments.

1.**Performance Impact**:

-**Performance Verification**: Conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation before and after deleting the structure, including training accuracy, validation accuracy, generalization ability, etc., to ensure that the model performance does not significantly decrease.

2.**Experimental verification**:

-**Experimental support**: Verify the effect of deleting the structure through experiments to ensure that the overall performance and functionality of the model are not negatively affected.

3.**Code and Architecture Maintenance**:

-**Code cleaning**: After deleting the structure, ensure the simplicity and maintainability of the code, remove unnecessary code fragments, and keep the code repository clean.

4.**User feedback**:

-**User Experience**: If the model is used in a production environment or for user use, ensure that the deleted structure can meet user needs, and continuously optimize and improve the model structure through user feedback.

Optimize the details and range of feature extraction by adjusting the convolution kernel and stride. By changing the number of neurons, balance the model's expressive power and computational cost. Choose an appropriate activation function to improve the training effectiveness and convergence speed of the model.

-**Adjust convolution kernel size**: Change the size, stride, and padding of the convolution kernel to change the size of the feature map and the way features are extracted.

-**Change the number of neurons**: Adjust the number of neurons in the fully connected layer to control the complexity and computational complexity of the model.

-**Change activation function**: Change the activation function (such as changing from ReLU to Leaky ReLU) to change the non-linear expression ability of the model.

Adjust the size and tensor dimension of the feature map to meet the input and output requirements of different layers of the model. Increase the details of the feature map through upsampling and extract high-level features through downsampling. Ensure consistent data flow between different layers in the model structure to prevent errors caused by dimensional mismatches.

-**Upsampling/Downsampling**: Changing the size of the feature map, such as downsampling through pooling layers or upsampling through upsampling layers (such as deconvolution and interpolation).

-**Dimension adjustment**: Adjust the dimensions of tensors in the middle layer of the network to ensure tensor compatibility between different layers.

-Reshaping Tensor: Before fully connected layers, it is usually necessary to reshape the multi-dimensional tensor output by the convolutional layer into a one-dimensional tensor.

In the development of deep learning models, careful consideration is needed when expanding or reducing the dimensions or shapes of the middle layers to ensure model performance and training stability. Although specific thresholds may vary depending on the task and dataset, the following are some general recommendations and guidelines:

1.**Number of channels in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**

-**Increase the number of channels**: It is recommended to increase the number of channels by no more than twice each time. For example, increasing from 64 channels to 128 channels instead of directly increasing from 64 channels to 256 channels. This can gradually increase the complexity of the model and avoid excessive complexity.

-**Reduce the number of channels**: It is recommended to reduce the number of channels by no more than half each time. For example, reducing from 128 channels to 64 channels instead of directly reducing to 32 channels. This can gradually reduce computational complexity and maintain model performance.

2.**Number of neurons in fully connected layer (FC)**

-**Increase the number of neurons**: It is recommended to increase the number by 1.5 to 2 times each time. For example, increasing from 512 neurons to 768 or 1024 neurons. This can gradually increase the expressive power of the model.

-**Reduce the number of neurons**: It is recommended to reduce the amount by no more than half each time. For example, reducing from 1024 neurons to 512 neurons. This can reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting.

3.**Matching of input and output dimensions**

-**Dimension Matching**: When adjusting the dimensions of the middle layer, ensure that the input and output dimensions match. For example, when adding a pooling layer or upsampling layer after a convolutional layer, ensure that the output dimension is consistent with the input dimension of the next layer.

4. Batch normalization and regularization**

-Batch normalization: Adding a batch normalization layer helps stabilize the training process and prevent gradient vanishing or exploding when expanding or reducing dimensions.

-**Regularization**: Use regularization techniques such as Dropout to control the complexity of the model, especially when expanding dimensions, to prevent overfitting.

a. Precautions when expanding dimensions or shapes

1.**Computational resources and training time**: Expanding the dimension will increase the computational workload and training time of the model, and it is necessary to evaluate whether there are sufficient computational resources to support it. In addition, gradually expanding the dimension can observe changes in training time and performance, avoiding insufficient resources or excessively long training time caused by excessive one-time adjustments.

2.**Model performance improvement**: Gradually expanding dimensions can help find the optimal model complexity, avoiding blindly increasing dimensions without performance improvement. It is possible to verify the performance changes after each adjustment through experiments and find the balance point between performance and computing resources.

b. Precautions when reducing dimensions or shapes

1.**Model expressive power**: Reducing dimensions will reduce the model's expressive power, and it is necessary to ensure that the model can still effectively extract and represent features after reducing dimensions. Gradually reducing dimensions can observe changes in model performance, avoiding performance degradation caused by over simplification.

2.**Training Stability**: Gradually reducing dimensions can help maintain the stability of the training process and avoid unstable model training caused by excessive one-time adjustments. The training effect after each adjustment can be verified through experiments to ensure the stability and performance of the model.

2.**Training Script**:

In the model execution script, developers can flexibly control the training process of the model and optimize its performance by adjusting and replacing the loss function and optimizer. The specific contents and motivations of these operations include:

1.**Modify loss function**: Select or customize an appropriate loss function to more accurately express optimization objectives and improve model performance.

2.**Adjusting optimizer parameter values**: By adjusting parameters such as learning rate, momentum, and weight decay, the training dynamics are controlled to prevent overfitting or underfitting.

3.**Replace with a new loss function**: Use more advanced or suitable loss functions for specific problems, handle imbalanced categories, multi task optimization, etc., and achieve better convergence.

4.**Replace with a new optimizer**: Select or replace a suitable optimizer to improve training efficiency and stability, and adapt to different models and data characteristics.

These operations enable developers to continuously optimize and improve the model training process, ultimately achieving more efficient and accurate deep learning models.

Choosing an appropriate loss function can more accurately express optimization objectives, thereby improving model performance. For example, cross entropy loss can better handle probability distribution problems in classification tasks. By customizing the loss function, specific problems can be optimized to improve the accuracy and stability of the model.

-**Choose the appropriate loss function**: Choose the appropriate loss function based on the task type. For example, classification tasks typically use cross entropy loss functions, while regression tasks use mean squared error (MSE) loss functions.

-**Custom loss function**: Write custom loss functions for specific needs, such as combining multiple loss functions in multitasking learning or using perceptual loss in image generation tasks.

By adjusting the optimizer parameters, dynamic behaviors such as convergence speed and oscillation during the training process can be better controlled, achieving more stable training results. Appropriate weight attenuation and learning rate adjustment can effectively prevent overfitting or underfitting of the model, thereby improving its generalization ability.

-**Learning rate**: Adjust the learning rate to control the convergence speed of the model. A high learning rate may lead to model divergence, while a low learning rate may result in long training time.

-**Momentum**: Adjust momentum parameters to smooth gradient updates and prevent excessive oscillation. Momentum helps accelerate gradient descent and stabilize convergence.

-**Weight attenuation (regularization term)**: Control the complexity of the model by adjusting the weight attenuation parameters to prevent overfitting. The regularization term increases the penalty for large weights, which helps to maintain the simplicity of the model.

The new loss function may have better performance for specific problems, such as class imbalance or multi task optimization, thereby improving the overall performance of the model. Some new loss functions can provide smoother gradients, helping the model converge faster and more stably during the training process.

-**Replace with a more advanced loss function**: For example, in classification tasks, change from cross entropy loss to Focal Loss to address class imbalance issues.

-**Use Combination Loss**: In complex tasks such as object detection, a combination of multiple loss functions (such as localization loss and classification loss) is used to optimize multiple targets simultaneously.

Different optimizers perform differently on different models and datasets, and selecting the most suitable optimizer can improve training effectiveness. The adaptive learning rate optimizer can better address the problem of learning rate setting, improve training efficiency, and to some extent solve the problems of gradient vanishing and exploding.

-**Choose the appropriate optimizer**: Select the appropriate optimizer based on the characteristics of the model and task. For example, the Adam optimizer is suitable for most situations, but in some cases, SGD (Random Gradient Descent) momentum may perform better.

-**Use adaptive learning rate optimizers**, such as RMSprop and AdamW, which can dynamically adjust the learning rate, improve training efficiency and effectiveness.

3.**Data Processing Script**:

In data preprocessing scripts, developers often perform operations such as data cleaning and preprocessing, data augmentation, dataset partitioning, data format conversion, feature engineering, and data loading and batch processing. These operations aim to improve data quality and consistency, ensuring that the model can correctly understand and process the data. By increasing the diversity of the dataset, overfitting and merging can be prevented to improve the robustness of the model. Reasonable partitioning of the dataset helps to accurately evaluate model performance and reduce bias. Data format conversion ensures data compatibility with different frameworks and tools, while optimizing storage and reading efficiency. Feature engineering improves model performance and reduces data dimensions by extracting and constructing important features. Finally, optimizing the data loading process can improve training efficiency and reduce memory usage. Through these operations, developers can ensure data quality, improve model performance, and improve training and inference efficiency.

Clean and preprocess data, improve data integrity and consistency, and ensure that the model can correctly understand and process the data. By normalizing and standardizing, dimensional differences are eliminated to help the model converge faster and improve training effectiveness.

-**Handling missing values**: Fill in, delete, or interpolate missing values in data. For example, using mean and median to fill in missing values, or using KNN interpolation method.

-**Outlier detection and handling**: Identify and handle outliers, such as deleting outlier data points or replacing them with reasonable values.

-**Data normalization and standardization**: Scaling data to the same range or performing standardization processing, such as normalizing data to the [0,1] interval or performing z-score standardization.

By enhancing data and increasing the diversity of the dataset, the model can better generalize and prevent overfitting. Increase the variability of data, help the model cope with the diversity and uncertainty of real-world data, and improve the robustness of the model.

-**Image Data Enhancement**: Rotate, flip, crop, scale, color transform, and other operations on the image to increase the diversity of training data.

-**Text Data Enhancement**: Perform synonym replacement, deletion, insertion and other operations on text data to increase the diversity of training corpus.

-**Time series data augmentation**: Performing noise addition, time misalignment, data smoothing, and other operations on time series data.

By properly partitioning the dataset, the performance of the model can be accurately evaluated, ensuring that the model performs well on unprecedented data. Using methods such as cross validation can reduce the bias caused by data partitioning and obtain more stable evaluation results.

-**Division of training set, validation set, and test set**: Divide the dataset into training set, validation set, and test set in a certain proportion, such as an 8:1:1 ratio.

-**Cross validation partitioning**: Using the k-fold cross validation method, divide the dataset into k subsets and take turns as the validation and training sets for multiple training and evaluation.

By converting formats, it ensures that data can be used by different deep learning frameworks and tools, improving data compatibility and utilization. Using appropriate data formats and types can optimize data storage and reading speed, and improve data processing efficiency.

-**Format conversion**: Convert data from one format to another, such as from CSV to TFRecord, HDF5 format, or from image files to tensor format.

-**Type conversion**: Convert data types, such as converting integer data to floating-point data, or converting classification labels to one hot encoding.

Through feature engineering, more representative features are extracted and constructed to help models better understand data and improve model performance. By feature selection, the dimensionality of data is reduced, computational costs are reduced, and training efficiency is improved.

-**Feature extraction**: Extracting important features from raw data, such as extracting periodic features from time series data and TF-IDF features from text data.

-**Feature Selection**: By using methods such as correlation analysis and feature importance analysis, important features that are helpful for model training are selected, and redundant and irrelevant features are eliminated.

-**Feature construction**: By combining existing features or creating new derived features, the expressive power of the model is enhanced, such as constructing polynomial features, interactive features, etc.

Optimize the data loading process and improve overall training efficiency through batch processing and parallel loading. Load data in batches to avoid memory overflow issues caused by loading all data at once.

-Batch Load Data: Load the dataset in batches for training and inference, reducing memory usage and improving processing efficiency.

-Parallel Data Loading: Using multithreading or multiprocessing technology to load data in parallel, accelerating data reading speed and avoiding I/O bottlenecks.

Developers often modify model structure scripts and execution scripts, which directly affect the performance of the model and the quality of data, and are the core parts of model development and optimization. Modifying the model structure script is mainly to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model, adapt to the needs of new tasks and data, and solve specific problems such as overfitting and gradient vanishing. They achieve these goals by introducing new technologies, new layer types, and adjusting the model architecture, thereby optimizing the overall performance of the model. In executing scripts, developers often adjust the loss function and optimizer parameters, select the appropriate optimizer, and dynamically adjust training parameters to improve the efficiency and stability of the training process. In addition, they will also optimize the evaluation and inference process to ensure that the model performs well in practical applications and meets specific performance requirements.

### (3) Factors to consider when making modifications

### Data related factors

1.**Data Quality**:

-**Data cleaning**: Ensure that training data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise and incorrect labels.

-**Data augmentation**: Use data augmentation techniques to improve the model's generalization ability.

2.**Data Distribution**:

-**Training/Test Set Division**: Reasonably divide the training and test sets to ensure consistent data distribution and avoid data leakage.

-Balance: Ensure the balance of the dataset and avoid bias caused by imbalanced categories.

### Security and Compliance

1.**Security Review**:

-**Code Review**: Conduct a code review after modification to ensure that no security vulnerabilities or malicious code have been introduced.

-**Dependency Review**: Check the security of introduced third-party libraries and dependencies to avoid using unsafe libraries.

2.**Privacy Protection**:

-**Data Privacy**: Ensure that training data does not contain sensitive information and comply with data privacy protection regulations.

-**Model Privacy**: Use techniques such as differential privacy to protect the privacy of the model output and prevent the leakage of training data.

### Other factors

1.**Hardware Compatibility**:

-**Hardware Adaptation**: Ensure that the model can run efficiently on the target hardware (such as GPU, TPU) and fully utilize hardware acceleration.

-**Resource usage**: Monitor the memory and storage usage of the model to avoid resource waste.

2.**Scalability**:

-**Deployment Optimization**: Optimize the model deployment process to ensure efficient operation in the production environment.

(4) Identification of model legitimacy

1.**The model structure is too complex**:

-**Parameter redundancy**: There are a large number of redundant parameters in the model, which may lead to wastage of computing resources and overfitting.

-**Computational complexity**: The computational complexity of the model far exceeds the actual requirements, resulting in long training and inference times.

2.**Calculation time exceeds the standard**:

-**Abnormal training time**: The model training time significantly exceeded expectations, which may be due to ineffective optimization processes or unreasonable model architecture.

-Abnormal inference time: If the inference time is too long, it may affect the response speed and user experience of actual applications.

If the training time of the modified model exceeds twice that of the original model (i.e. an increase of 100%), it can be considered that the model has anomalies and further investigation is needed.

Absolute time threshold: For some specific tasks, an absolute time threshold can be set. For example, if the original model has a training time of 30 minutes per round and is modified for more than 60 minutes, it can be considered abnormal.

Comparison of inference time:

If the inference time of the modified model exceeds 1.5 times that of the original model (i.e. an increase of 50%), it can be considered that the model may be too complex or have efficiency issues.

Absolute time threshold: For example, if the inference time of the original model is 100 milliseconds, and it exceeds 150 milliseconds after modification, it can be considered abnormal.

Practical application standards

Image classification tasks (such as ResNet50):

Training time: The original model has a training time of 30 minutes per round. If the modified model exceeds 60 minutes (an increase of 100%), further inspection is required.

Inference time: The original model inference time is 200 milliseconds. If it exceeds 300 milliseconds (an increase of 50%) after modification, further inspection is required.

Natural language processing tasks (such as BERT base):

Training time: The original model has a training time of 3 hours per round, and if the modified model exceeds 6 hours (an increase of 100%), further inspection is required.

Inference time: The original model inference time is 50 milliseconds. If it exceeds 75 milliseconds (an increase of 50%) after modification, further inspection is required.

3.**Precision of intermediate layer output**:

-**Numerical Stability**: The numerical accuracy output by the middle layer exceeds the effective range, which may lead to numerical instability and calculation errors.

-**Overflow and underflow**: There is a risk of floating-point overflow or underflow, which affects the overall stability of the model.
